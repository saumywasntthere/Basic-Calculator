# Basic Calculator

This project is a simple command-line calculator built that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator accepts user input and ensures valid numbers are entered before performing the desired operation. It includes error handling for invalid inputs and avoids division by zero.

Key Features:
User Input Validation: The program checks for valid numerical inputs and handles invalid entries by reprompting the user.

Arithmetic Functions: Supports four basic operationsâ€”addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

Zero Division Handling: Prevents division by zero by prompting the user to enter a valid non-zero divisor.

Continuous Input Checking: Prompts the user until a valid operation and numbers are entered, ensuring smooth user interaction.

Modular Design: Each arithmetic operation is handled by a separate function (add, subtract, multiply, divide), following good programming practices.
